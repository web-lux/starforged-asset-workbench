# Starforged Asset Workbench

Inspired by effortlessmoutain's [Asset Workbench](https://github.com/effortlessmountain/ironsworn-asset-workbench), the *Starforged Asset Workbench* can be used to create custom assets for [Ironsworn : Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged) while keeping the same aesthetic as the game's default assets.
