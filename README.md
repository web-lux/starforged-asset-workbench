‚ñ∂Ô∏è [App](https://starforged-asset-workbench.vercel.app/)

## üìÑ Description
Inspired by effortlessmoutain's [Asset Workbench](https://github.com/effortlessmountain/ironsworn-asset-workbench), the *Starforged Asset Workbench* can be used to create custom assets for [Ironsworn : Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged) while keeping the same aesthetic as the game's default assets.

## üí° Tips
- For the image, you can easily find icons at [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) and host it on Imgur. I suggest changing the background to "none" and the foreground to black in game-icons editor to stick with Starforged's aesthetic !
